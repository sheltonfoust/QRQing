# QRQing
A web application to manage lines for office hours. This was a project for the Spring 2024 Software Development Project Lab at Texas Tech. I lead a team of three to make a web app for the department advisor for students to join the line for his office hours by scanning a QR code. The website was made in ASP.NET Blazor Core using C#. It accesses its database using EF Core. Real-time updates are supported using SignalR for RPCs.
